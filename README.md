# python3_ud120
This is the source code of Udacity "Intro to Machine Learning" projects, written in Python 3, which is orginally written in Python 2.
Just clone the repo and start working on the mini-projects right away. This is pretty much plug & play.
Please do not make any chances in the script/or rename the files, to avoid unexpected errors.
Although I have not tested the code completely, which I'll be doing along the way, but at least it is a good start.
